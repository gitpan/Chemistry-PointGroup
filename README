Group theory for normal modes of vibration

Many common molecules, for example, water, ammonia, methane,etc.,
possess some symmetry. In calculating the normal modes and frequencies
of vibration, symmetry considerations can reduce enormously the labor
of the calculations. The symmetry and geometry of a molecular model can
be used to determine the number and symmetry of fundamental frequencies,
their degeneracies, the selection rules for the infrared and Raman spectra.
